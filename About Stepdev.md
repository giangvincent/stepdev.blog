# About StepDev

Hi, I'm Giang.

As a software developer, I have had practiced several languages of programming and faced many problems without solid solution or steps to handle that problems.

I start StepDev as a blog to write down my journal in learning languages of programming and facing problems in coding, if some of my blog help anything for you then maybe you can share it for every one near you to help them.

Also this blog help me to improve my writing skill and learn new language.

Any one can feel free to read and copy my code if that would help you in your journey of Coding. 

I will try to publish as many contents per week as possible, hope you can follow me and enjoy my works.
