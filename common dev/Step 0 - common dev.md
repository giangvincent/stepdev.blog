# STEP 0

Hello, This is the very first Step in coding. For a common sense when you step on the software development, something must be achieved to start.

## Mindset

First thing you must understand that software is for people to use, software is a tool and it used to help people complete their work.
Software is a complex thing, so you must have a consistency mind and willingness to make one.
If you want to be a software developer, you need to develop yourself a mindset that appropriate for the job. There are something for you to think about:
- Be curious, want to take its part to see how it works.
- Be Willing to solve problems, detect others problems and attempt to solve them.
- Be able to seperate a complex thing into pieces and have capability to assemle pieces into a complex.
- Consistency both on learning and working.

## Logic

Once you know what you need to accquire to make a software, then the next thing you must prepare is your logic on software development.
This is not a skill, It just a sense. When you come to write a software there're a lot of things does not make sense to you. That is why you need to your logic to read through many code lines to understand what is this program does.
Not every logic is the same. Maybe mine be different than you, maybe I will understand that programs differ than you understand them. Just develop your logic the way you comfort the most.
But some logic must be accquired. For example, machine will understand code from above to bottom of a file :v .

## Algorithm

This is something that you will use through all your career when you still stick with the programming. Unless you transfer into some others area in IT industry or become a must higher position in your career.
There are a lot of algorithms that must accquired to remember to program lots faster (no employers like slow programmers).


## Soft Skills

Most of skills need for a dev is belong to soft skills.
