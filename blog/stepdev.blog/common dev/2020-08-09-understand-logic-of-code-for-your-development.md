summary: A software contain many programs, assets like images, audios, videos or something that even more complicate like 3D models. A program contain many lines of code, this codes are divided or constructed by rules. That rules are important. Because if there is no rule, computer will not understand what need to run.

# Computer is dumb.

It doesn't know what to do or doesn't do exactly what we really want it to do. So we write programs , clean programs, with clear structure and data for it to do what we really want to do.

And then we have to compile that prorams to binary codes. Some programs need to compiled before enable to run anythings. Some programs do not need to compiled at all, because it can be read by some specific softwares, and translate direct to computer language.

# First, the simplest logic code

It is that codes are read from top to bottom of program.
Just like you write down a document, when someone are going to read it. They will read it from left to right, and from top to bottom.

Some of programming languages do not allow code be read until the last row had been read. But some of programming languages do allow that action is happened. For example, in PHP computer can not read next line until previous line of code is read and handled , and that is normal, but in Javascript, computer can read next line even if the previous line have some asynchronous code need to wait. It will read to last row of codes. That called non-blocking programming language.

# Second, RULES

There are some rules may have benefit for your programming skill.
OOP programming is a important and very popular programming rule.
OOP mean object oriented programming.

Components programming is a new one that approve to front-end dev.

MVC is a type of model that help you to orgarnize your backend project.

API and Micro services are some advanced rule, they can contain all of above rules and really hard to learn and approve to projects.

So, this is just a summary that something you need to picture the future of your programming skill. Hope from now on if you want to roll in software programming, then you have to prepare knowledge for your skills.

Thanks for read. Have peace.
