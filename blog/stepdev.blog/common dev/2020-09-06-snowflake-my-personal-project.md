# Step 4: Personas

1. Giang is a lazy guy want to learn new english words everyday. But the problem is he has to go to multi social sitesm to find english articles, sometime he read contents he like, sometime he read contents relevant to his career, sometime when he read those articles he will stump apon some new words then he will look up dictionary the meaning of the word. If the meaning that maybe use widely then he will take note that word to a text file or create a post somewhere he usually go to, like Facebook page.
2. Charles is a good english student and he is vietnamese. He currently study at Greenwick University which is an english university located in non-native enlish country. His major is international business management. His teachers use english all the time to teach students. He currently join multi english learning community. And he is an active person. He usually help others for learning english and he really good at it. But lack of tool to do it, so he have to learn adobe photoshop to create content which is hard for him. Most of the time he use his phone only which may be enough because he only create simple subject or simple content.
3. Judy is an english teacher of an english center. She want to help others to learning english, therefore she usually organize meeting offline at a coffee shop. Because lack of social network really efective and most of students use facebook, so she use facebook group to organize ideas, contents and have useful post to spread her ideas and knowledge to all others. But she feel like that was not enough. Only people who joined or followed that group can see and obtain her ideas. And not all people can see or really interest because the facebook algorithms.
