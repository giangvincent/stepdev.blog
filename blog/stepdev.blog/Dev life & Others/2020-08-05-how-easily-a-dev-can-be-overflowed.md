I am writing this blog in the august of the year 2020. This year the PHP language has became 25 years old and still be one of the popular programming language for website development.
But trust me PHP is not the oldest language you will be learnt in someday. Nowaday there's tons of different languages, not even mention to codes, packages, programs can be reused or implemented.
But that not all. There are others problems that not relate to code at all.

## The expectation of the clients

We make software for them, so they have the right to expect us to deliver to them the best software you can made.
So what make us overflowed ?
It's the requirements, that is not understand of each others. Most of the time, talking with clients is not your business, It's belong to business department or maybe your boss or manager. Its not because they can not trust you to persuade clients Its because talking with clients is their field and they have skills for that, they're trained to do that.
But not all the time. Sometime you will face with the clients and the first thing that came to you is not understand what they are trying to save. And then we have to explain to them by our language :v .
We have to prepared ourself soft skills, so that we will not smash our keyboard or scream to their face. Some will stand, and take all of client's words without saying anything.
Im not mentioned freelancers, because they have to that. It's their business. Im talk to ordinary developers that work for company, 9-to-5 kind of job. That developers, they like me, want to work with our enviroments, and feel comfortable with that. We do what we do the best that is solve problems. Some of that time, we will solve problems for others, with the clients, without our translations(maybe business departments or our boss or our manager).
What do we need to do ?
We do what we do the best, persistent explain. You say what you will do or done in english. So that they (the clients) will understand. Maybe they will understand by their languages, their inteligent. Let's just consider this is a problems, think and say back like a developer. Like the time you saw a bug, what would you do. When you in the enviroment that you dont know, try to transform that enviroment to the one that make you comfortable.
Sometime you will be face someone that so stuborn and rigid, they do not accept anything you say. Well, when it's happen just let go and leave. Dont stay or say more because of your manager or your boss, we are developers, we will have another opportunities. Dont worry that you will loose your job, Im sure your boss or your manager will solve that problem of clients.

## The expectation of your co-workers or your bosses or your friends

The clients is the stranger to you but your co-workers or you boss or your friends is the one that you knew. When they ask you to do something they will explain it in your language, but sometime they do not. Because you know them so you can explain easily and not spend much time for that.

And because they know you, they will expect more. The software that you made, the codes that you wrote. They will expect more efficency or better or the best. But when you deliver results to them, they just show attitude. Nah, It's so normal, nothing special, or have an unhappy smile.

In that situation, the only thing that you want to do is skip them. Skip their behavior. Right? But I advice you to ask them back, and listen to their opinions. Ask straight and listen by your heart. Dont affraid dont angry dont sad. Let's make that a lesson. Despite of their attitude, their words. It's maybe hurt you a little bit but It will pass. Lower your ego and you maybe learn something.

I know this is a soft skill. But when you curious about what they try to say, you will not pay your attention to their behavior anymore. You will focus on your products, your programs, your codes. And that time is the best time that you find your solution to your problems.

## Always happy

As a developer the best time of mine would be the time that a problem be solved. All of the others not important anymore. Ignore all bad behavior, Ignore all bad words. Focus on what you do best, solve problems, and then you will be happy. Is that your purpose for programming, for development ? If that would be true, then congrats, you are what you are now. If not maybe consider to upgrade yourself to another department like boss or manager or maybe business department :v
