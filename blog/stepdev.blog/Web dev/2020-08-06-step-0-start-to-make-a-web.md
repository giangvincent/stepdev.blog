Okay, after hear the requirements, after all argument and discuss, now is time for real shit.

## First thing is choose how you are going to work.

This step is setup the project management tools. Most of the time, you maybe use tools to do this like Trello, Github management, Todo App,...
You will write down all the steps to complete the project. I think you should not spend much time for this step. Because in time you will change steps to steps for more suitable work.
After project management, you will setup the enviroments and the technology for development project.
Now all of your knowledge that you have learnt before. The first step if you want to code. Event "Hello world" programs.
For example:
If you want to code front-end by using VueJs, you must have install vue-cli
`npm install -g @vue/cli`
or
`yarn global add @vue/cli`
then
`vue create new-project`
And now you wait.

If you want to code back-end that use PHP and MySQL, you will need to setup Xampp.
Or you want to code NodeJS , you must install node in you computer.
That's it and you good to go.

## Next things will determine how fast will you go

That is Commiting. Not commit to git, if you think of that. You will use git obviously. But I want to say about commit to time management for letting you spend time on your prject.
If you are freelancers or event students, that would be your primary task and you will do it smoothly. Unless you are too lazy, then that would not be your problem at all.
And if you are employees, and this project is your primary task then you have to force yourself into it. This is your money maker so obviously you not have a choice here.
Just spend 9-to-5 for all weekdays, then I'm sure you will complete your project in matter of weeks.
But if you are employees and this project is not the money maker at all, or this project is just extra activity fro you to improve your programming skills and your knowledge. Then you have to come up with a specific time management and really commit to it.
I want to say about the mind power of your.
You see it easy to give up a project that take away time and efforts of your. You do not see clearly result of that project at all. So you must prepare yourself a greate mind power , and day by day refill it.
And I think that power will help you for almost everything in life no matter what.
